Mithril Instability Engine (v1.0)Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) Analysis for Market Singularity Detection📌 Project OverviewThe Mithril Engine is a quantitative research tool designed to identify "Super-Exponential" price trends and speculative bubbles in financial markets. Using the Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) framework, the engine detects the mathematical hallmarks of "herding" behavior that typically precedes a regime shift or market crash.This engine doesn't just track price; it tracks the instability of the price trend itself.🛠 Features7-Parameter Optimization: Implementation of the LPPL equation using SciPy's least_squares (Levenberg-Marquardt) optimizer.Multi-Scale Windowing: Analyzes 15 distinct look-back windows to ensure signal stability and reduce "false positives."Criticality & Hazard Metrics: * Criticality: Measures the degree of crowd synchronization ($>55$ indicates extreme danger).Hazard Score: Calculates the instantaneous probability of a crash singularity occurring at $t_{today}$.Automated Regime Classification: Categorizes assets into NORMAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL based on metric convergence.🔬 Mathematical FoundationThe engine fits the natural log of price $ln P(t)$ to the J.-P. Bouchaud/Sornette formulation:$$ln P(t) = A + B(t_c - t)^m [1 + C \cos(\omega \ln(t_c - t) + \phi)]$$Where:$t_c$: The predicted time of the crash (Singularity).$m$: Power-law growth exponent ($0.1 < m < 0.9$ for valid bubbles).$\omega$: Frequency of log-periodic oscillations representing market "wiggles."📊 Performance Case Study: Silver Futures (SI=F)During the February 2026 simulation, the engine successfully flagged a high-risk singularity in Silver:Signal Date: Feb 2, 2026Hazard Score: 0.249 (Highly significant)Criticality: 58.53Result: The engine identified a $t_c$ (crash date) only 13 days from $t_{today}$, successfully capturing the peak of a 5x parabolic run.
